  * Define canvas context as entity property
      Ques: what if an entity as to be drawn on another canvas?
      Answ: it is highly improbable... entities are supposed to be drawn only on scene (and should remain as it)
      Plus: this will broke the savegame procedure as the canvas context will be registered as a cyclic reference in a JSON object

  ~ Change set path technique
      Org  : add (+x, +y)
      Alt  : set (x, y)
      Issue: when changing destination during move the resulting position is not the last position clicked (due to add technique)
      Patch: won't be fixed because this should never happen in game (1-select destination, 2-move to destination without interruption)
      Edit1: add technique kept for routine (i.e. set path based on tile increment from origin when the script is executed)
           : set technique used for calling (i.e. set path based on destination for running the script)
           : both techniques may work along (i.e. it is possible to use the add technique for running the script)
      Edit2: both methods are DEPRECATED ; only the moveTo() and moveOf() methods are allowed for moving characters

  ° Split characters
      Marine => controllable ; friendly (move by input) -- human
      Alien  => uncontrollable ; hostile (AI) -- computer

  ° Use only one image per character charged at load up

  ! Accessibility : key arrows used for moving the cursor on the screen, tab to switch between buttons
    ! Arr => move cursor
    ! Ctrl+Arr => scroll screen
    + Terminal Roll, Order and Equipment

  ? Animated Cursor : add frames between cursor change state

  ? Interactive Cursor : non pointing cursor when not hover a clickable element (i.e. hand palm instead of pointing finger)

  ? Replace 'Identify mode' by '<Detect/View/Radar> mode'

  ? Different minimap colors for marines (like DOS version)

  ? Chars can't shoot when engaged in melee (only lineal)

  ? Open door cost 1 movement action => register move action as points

  ? Add tile bitmap under identify picture (require tile detection, i.e. tile type stored in grid)

  ? Draw line of sight on target range hover

  ? Pop-hover points

  ? Draw stars in void

  ? Click on monitor switches between Status/Turn+Event+Points

  ? Display 'arrow' pointing to focused actor when out of screen

  ? Add visual trails while character is moving

  ? Use quadratic curve instead of ugly calc for rocket projectile lob effect

  ? Add a visual indicator on sprite board for hovered face members (like whiten effect or pop-over icon)

  ? Add a visual indicator when a char move is interrupted due to hidden pawn ; like a popping exclamation point

  ? Only one counter-attack on melee attack

  ? Change order behaviour
    1) let order button activable until any team member has moved or attacked
    2) activate order choice box and button on turn begin -- POSSIBLY GOOD CHOICE
    x) optionally, select team commander if not gone

  ? Add Dice, Armor, Move and/or Life to Identify

  ? Add animation on focus reticle

  ? Add a timeout for reroll (like 5-10 seconds) before auto-cancel

  ? Hold shift show sight range

  ? Rotating avatars on identify

  ? Limit scan usage (core rules = once per board)

  ? Use a dropping bomb from above animation for 'exploding_trap' event

  ? Use a spawning from floor turret animation for 'auto_defence' event

  ? Use a spawning from floor fleshripper animation for 'fleshripper' event

  ? On time out, either a big ray blast any still on map marine, either a huge alien spawn and kill still on map marine

  ? Display remaining turns at end of alien turn instead of at start

  ? Decrease or increase number of turns according to number of marine teams in game

  ? Add visual indicator when screen is locked (like dashed boarder or lock icon)

  ? Animated portrait àla Doom

  ? Marks primary objective on minimap

  ? Mother Transmission also marks secondary objective on minimap

  ? Glow effect on range slabs (e.g. move range)
