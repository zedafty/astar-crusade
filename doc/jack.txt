# Hijack : Space Mogette
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================

# Pitch
  "Year 10492 in a galaxy far far away"
  "All was for the best in the known universe before the Space Mogette sprung out from <limbo/outer space/the expanse>"
  "Popping from the Space Mogette like acne from a teenage face, aliens <took place> in abandoned ships and <forsaken/derelicted> stations, making a mess of it"
  "...by playing baby foot..."
  "...smoking weed..."
  "...and listening to demoscene music all night long"
  "--NO! That can't be!--"
  "Pissed of by aliens' presence and lifestyle, A* fleet goes on war to eradicate the Space Mogette spawns"
  "Now, A* troopers are the last resort of humankind to restore public safety and morale rights in the galaxy"
  "--C'mon boyz! Time to shoot greenies!--"
